The p-value for the linear correlation of the week 1 firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio and the BMI of all the participants is .94, which is not statistically significant. The R^2 value was also insignificant being very small at R^2=-.0073. There is no significant correlation between the week 1 firmicutes - bacteroidetes ratio and BMI.

Similarly, the week 3 F - B ratio and BMI also had an insignifcant p-value and R^2 value at p=.67 and R^2 = -.006 respectively. This also represents no significant correlation.




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

The p-value for the linear correlation of the week 1 firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio and the week 1 Butyrate concentration of all the participants is .0037, which is statistically significant. However, the R^2 value is insignificant being very small at R^2=0.0053, which represents too much variation in the data. There is no significant correlation between the week 1 firmicutes - bacteroidetes ratio and Butyrate Concentration.

The week 3 F - B ratio and week 3 Butyrate concentration of all the participants has a insignifcant p-value and R^2 value at p=.29 and R^2 = 0.0011 respectively. This also represents no significant correlation.

The p-value for the linear correlation of the week 1 firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio and the week 1 Propionate concentration of all the participants is .0066, which is statistically significant. However, the R^2 value is insignificant being very small at R^2=0.0048, which represents too much variation in the data. There is no significant correlation between the week 1 firmicutes - bacteroidetes ratio and Propionate concentration.

Similarly, The week 3 F - B ratio and week 3 Propionate concentration of all the participants has a signifcant p-value and insignificant R^2 value at p=.0043 and R^2 = .053 respectively. This also represents no significant correlation.
